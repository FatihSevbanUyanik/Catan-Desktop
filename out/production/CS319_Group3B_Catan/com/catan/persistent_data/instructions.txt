Setup: Setup the board as either a copy of the introductory setup, randomly flip over tiles and place the numbers in alphabetical order spiraling in, or completely randomly tiles and numbers.
Advanced Setup: If using a random board, choose settlement placements in player order, then a second settlement in backwards order, with a road attached to each.
Playing Development Cards: For your turn, you can play 1 development card at any time (including before you roll), but not one that you bought that turn.
Income Roll dice for income that turn - everyone with settlements/cities next to a tile with that number gets one/two of that resource per settlement/city adjacent to it (respectively).
The Robber: If you roll a 7, you must move the robber (that weird bowling pin looking thing) to any hex of your choice. Then choose a player that has a settlement/city next to that hex. Steal a card at random from their hand. While the robber stays their, that hex doesn't produce anything (you can signify this by putting him on top of the number.) Using a Knight card allows you to perform this entire action immediately. Then, if this was a 7-roll (not a Knight), each player with 8+ resource cards in hand (not development cards) discards half of their choice, keeping rounded up.
Buy/Trade Then you can offer/receive trades and buy things. People can only trade with the current player. The offers do not have to be equal, they often won't be. I.e. if everyone wants to build a city, then Ore and Grain will be at a premium.
Bank Exchange The current player can also trade with the bank, either 4 of a single thing for 1 of anything (always an option), or use a port (i.e. 3:1 of any single resource, or 2:1 of a specific resource type for 1 of anything, instead) if you have a settlement/city on that port (there are 2 spots for each port.)
What to Buy There are 4 things you can buy: Roads, Settlements, Cities (an upgrade), and Development Cards. You can buy any number of them. (Use the 4 reference cards that come with the game for the costs.)
Roads You must have roads going from one of your settlements/cities to the location you are building a new settlement. Your starting settlements do not need to be connected to each other.
End Your Turn Then you pass the turn to the next player, and they start by either playing a development card or rolling the dice.
Victory You win when you have 10 points - 1 point per settlement, 2 points per city, 2 points for Largest Army (Minimum 3+) and/or Longest Road (Single continuous branch, no double counting, Minimum 5+), 1 point for victory point development cards (which are 5/25 development cards.)
Victory point development cards Victory point development cards are special. They're the only ones that may be played all at the same time, immediately, when you would win as a result. Otherwise, you must hold them and, if you want, perhaps pretend that they aren't victory point cards that could win you the game next turn if they let you do that one last trade.
